# Info Games Project

Flutter project to explain how can you use flutter bloc when you don't have enough experience with the library.

### Medium article

I've posted an article explaining the main concept of how you can use flutter bloc in a real app. 

- [Flutter bloc for begginers](https://medium.com/@ana.polo.sanchez1991/flutter-bloc-for-beginners-839e22adb9f5)


### Offical documentation about Flutter Bloc

- [Flutter bloc docs](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/)

Flutter bloc pub.dev 

- [Flutter bloc pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) 

### .env file (API KEY)

For this project I used .env directory to store my API Key, if you want to use it, you need to create this structure on the root of your app:

````
assets:
  - .env
````

Inside this file you need to put your API KEY like that:

````
YOUR_API_KEY = 'your api key code here';
````
For more info you can check the official documentation of [flutter_dotenv](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_dotenv) library.
